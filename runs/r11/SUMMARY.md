## 1. Training (best checkpoint, full-difficulty held-out set)

| model | best step | balanced | assoc (per-query) | state (control) | exact | lr | verdict |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| transformer | – | – | – | – | – | – | not trained yet |
| gated_linear | 14000 | 0.760 | 0.521 | 1.000 | 0.464 | 0.0015 | ok |
| hybrid | – | – | – | – | – | – | not trained yet |

Healthy = assoc high **and** state well above chance (~0.01). Full per-eval curves are in `logs/train.log` and the `*_sweep.json` files.

## 1b. Sanity gate — each model on its own training distribution

| model | assoc per-query | assoc exact | state per-query | state exact | gate |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| gated_linear | 0.484 | 0.142 | 1.000 | 1.000 | pass |

n=500 per mode. Both per-query columns must be well above chance (~0.01) before any sweep number means anything.

## 2. Pass 1 — capacity (the headline)
