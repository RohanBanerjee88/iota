## 1. Training (best checkpoint, full-difficulty held-out set)

| model | best step | balanced | assoc (per-query) | state (control) | exact | lr | verdict |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| transformer | – | – | – | – | – | – | not trained yet |
| gated_linear | 9500 | 0.627 | 0.255 | 1.000 | 0.392 | 0.00075 | ok |
| hybrid | – | – | – | – | – | – | not trained yet |

Healthy = assoc high **and** state well above chance (~0.01). Full per-eval curves are in `*_sweep_history.json` (and `logs/train.log`); `*_sweep.json` stops at the best checkpoint.
